    <string name="about_history">This temple has a history of 700 years. It is said that, once the tribal people of Medaram forest region went in to the deep forest for hunting. They saw a kid protected by cruel animals such as tigers and lions; they were all mesmerized with the child\'s magnificent presence and her glorious brightness. The tribal leaders (Koya doralu) adopted the child and brought her to the village. And the village has been shining with a lot of prosperity and happiness from the time when the kid came to this village. All the people in that village felt that, their God Kondadevara (tribal god) had reached them in the form of this child. The tribal elders named her as Sammakka. It is said that, she always rambled on tigers and lions and also gave her blessings to the child bearing couples. She cured number of tribals suffering from chronic deceases. These are the main reasons that made her become popular across the nearby villages. Sammakka was married to Pagididda Raju. He was the ruler of Medaram village and subordinate king of Prathapa Rudra, Kakatiya Dynasty. They were blessed with a son (Jampanna) and two daughters (Sarakka and Nagulamma). A severe famine occurred for four consecutive years in the village. People were shattered due to this famine and they were unable to pay the taxes. Hence, Pagididda Raju refused to pay the tax to the Kakatiya rulers. Due to this Kakatiya king got angry and decided to wage war under the command of Lieutenant Yugandarudu. The tribal people having self-respect decided to get ready to war and they were not scared of the Kakatiya army having a large number of elephantine forces. Thousands of tribal heads were chopped and the blood flew like river from the battle ground, and mixed with Sampenga Vagu (a water passageway). The water in the Sampenga Vagu was contaminated with blood. In this battle, all the tribal and non-tribal people participated against Kakatiya forces. Sammakka\'s husband Pagididda Raju and Son in Law Govindaraju laid their victorious lives in this battle. After watching this massacre, Jampanna (son of Sammakka) sacrificed himself, by jumping in to the Sampenga Vagu, hence it is called as Jampanna Vagu. Despite hearing this shocking news, Sammakka didn\'t give up her courage, and attacked enemy forces protected by a breast plate and sword. Showing her divine powers she destroyed and terrorized the enemies. Kakatiya forces were surprised by the divine powers of Sammakka. Suddenly a boy came from behind and back stroked Sammakka. Sammakka turned back and raised her sword to kill, but she realized that it was a kid and put the sword down. Sammakka forgave the child and tied the wound with a cloth and moved away from the village towards east as she was aware that if her blood falls on the village land, the land will become barren and gives no After the battle, the tribe elders searched for Sammakka in the thick of the forest. They found a Kumkum Bharini (vermillion box) at a snake hole under the Naga Vruksham (Naga- snake, Vruksham- tree). Tribals believed that, Sammakka was found as vermillion. Thence, once in two years on the day of Magha Shudha Poornima, the tribal people celebrate a festival/fair in the honor of Sammakka and her daughter Sarakka, where they got the vermillion box.</string>
